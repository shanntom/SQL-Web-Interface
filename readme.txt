SQL Web Interface

This project is a web interface that interacts with a SQL movie database. We used PHP to querry data from the database and display it on the HTML page. 

There are 5 different input pages where a user can insert information into the database. The browsing pages for actors and movies were combined into the search page. To search for any actor or movie, input the actor or movie in the the search page and choose the corresponding movie or actor to see the results. Any dropdown menu was ordered in alphabetical order. 


This project was a group effort. Shannon made the input pages, headers, and .css format of the page. Michelle implemented the search function.
