Project 1B
CS143

This project is a web interface that interacts with a movie database.
All criteria was meet in this project. There are 5 different input pages where 
a user can insert information into the database. The browsing pages for actors
and movies were combined into the search page. To search for any actor or movie,
input the actor or movie in the the search page and choose the corresponding
movie or actor to see the results. Any dropdown menu was ordered in alphabetical 
order. 

An additional index.php page was added and a .css file was included to format
the web interface. An additional header.html was used to define the header seen
in all the the web pages.

This project was a group effort. Shannon made the input pages, headers, and 
.css format of the page. Michelle implemented the search function. We worked 
well as a team. One aspect of that we could improve on is starting earlier.
The only pressure was time.
